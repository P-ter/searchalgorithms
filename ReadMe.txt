After having extracted the PDuong3.zip file, you will see a folder named Assignment3
Here is how to run this program:

-In addition, the complexity analysis for the Shellsort (which is my chosen sorting algorithm to implement) is included in the 
Class description in Shellsort class. Details can be found in my line comments (not in great detail).
